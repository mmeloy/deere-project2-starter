# MVP/PostMVP - 5min
The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP. Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.

# MVP EXAMPLE
Find and use external api
Render data on page
Allow user to interact with the page
PostMVP EXAMPLE
Add localStorage or firebase for storage
Components
Writing out your components and its descriptions isn't a required part of the proposal but can be helpful.
Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into stateless/stateful components.

# Component	Description
App	This will make the initial data pull and include React Router
Header	This will render the header include the nav
Footer	This will render the header include the nav
Time Frames
Time frames are also key in the development cycle. You have limited time to code all phases of the game. Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Also, put a gif at the top of your Readme before you pitch, and you'll get a panda prize.

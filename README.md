# Technologies Used
- HTML/EJS: the app uses embedded javascript to render information on the page
- Node & Express: the app has its own server, built using Express
- MVC Pattern: the app uses the Model View Controller (MVC) programming design pattern
- SQL/ PG-Promise: The app persists data and uses multiple SQL tables
- CSS3: The app is well-designed and considers user experience and usability
- JavaScript: the app has front-end interactivity
- JWT
- Bcrypt: the app uses bcrypt to encrypt user passwords
- Express-session: to store user sessions on the express server
- Cookie-parser: to parse cookies
- Heroku web hosting: the app is hosted on Heroku


# Issues and Resolutions
 I did not populate the model file with a new DB column, and it would not appear in my renders until I did that.

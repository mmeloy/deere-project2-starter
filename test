IOWA Chops Recipe
4 thick cut, bone-in, “Iowa” chops
(Should be at least 1” thick, closer 1.5” is much better, most of the time
I ask at the meat counter to have them cut for me 1.5” thick)

Marinade:
1- 1.5 cups of soy sauce, (lite or regular)
¼ cup of olive oil
1 med onion coarsely chopped
2 cloves fresh garlic
1 tsp ground pepper
1/3 c ketchup

Mix all ingredients together, pour over chops, cover, and refrigerate 8-24 hrs.  
(a large ziplock bag works well for this, place chops and marinade in bag, and then 
set the bag in a bowl or pan and refrigerate) rotate the chops from time to time 
to ensure they are evenly marinated.

Grilling:

Remove chops from marinade, discard marinade.
Brown chops on hot grill, 4-6 minutes each side.
Set chops on end (bone end, and grill another 12-16 minutes, depending on thickness)
•	 This is the key to this recipe, and why you want the chops to be as thick as possible, 
	(they will stand up easier)
•	Cooking (baking) on bone end will keep the chops from drying out.
